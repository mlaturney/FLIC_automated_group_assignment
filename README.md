# Using the fly liquid interaction counter (FLIC) to recording feeding behavior

## Summary

We used the fly liquid interaction counter (FLIC) to record feeding behavior of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). The benefits of FLIC over other methods is that it is a high throughput and unbiased way to record both feeding behavior. The goal of these experiments was to compare amount of feeding (total time or number of feeding bouts) across groups, which would ultimately allow us to uncover the neural basis of feeding modulation.
