# Using the fly liquid interaction counter (FLIC) to record feeding behavior in Drosophila melanogaster

## Summary

We used the fly liquid interaction counter (FLIC) to record feeding behavior of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). The benefits of FLIC over other methods is that it is a high throughput and unbiased way to record both feeding behavior. The goal of these experiments was to compare amount of feeding (total time or number of feeding bouts) across groups, which would ultimately allow us to uncover the neural basis of feeding modulation.

Each R file starts with attaching the "FLICFunctions", modifying the default parameters, and loading in the behavior data (DFMs).

Next, we generated a .csv file containing feeding behavior (total time or number of feeding bouts), within a specific time bin, and assinging ID, genotype, and condition. Compatible for mutation studies and optigenetics.
